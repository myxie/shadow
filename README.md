# _shadow_

ScHeduling Algorithms for Data-intensive Workflows (_shadow_)

_shadow_ is a library for the use and testing of workflow scheduling algorithms, with a focus on data-intensive science applications. _shadow_ provides implementations of various heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms to address single-and multi-objective scheduling problems, as well as a command-line interface that allows you to run these algorithms on pipelines, with schedule-reporting and visualisation options.
