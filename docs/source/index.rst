Motivation
----------

SHADOW has been designed to test the effectiveness  of algorithms
that may be used to schedule Radio Interferometry pipelines for the Square
kilometre Array (SKA). It is hoped that the library becomes a repository of
workflow scheduling heuristics and metaheuristics, as well as tool in which
algorithm developers may test and benchmark their own efforts.
