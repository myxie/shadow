What is SHADOW?
=================

SHADOW is a library for the use and testing of DAG-based workflow scheduling algorithms. SHADOW provides implementations of various heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms to address single-and multi-objective scheduling problems; these algorithms are accessed using a workflow-oriented class system built into the library.


Motivation
----------

Development of the SHADOW library was motivated by a lack of public implementations of popular and highly-cited workflow scheduling algorithms.   It is hoped that the library becomes a repository of
workflow scheduling heuristics and metaheuristics, as well as tool in which
algorithm developers may test and benchmark their own efforts.
