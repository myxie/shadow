=========
Roadmap 
=========


This document details the intended functionality that will be present in the 'official' 0.1 release (currently its status would be 'alpha'). 

Algorithms
^^^^^^^^^^

By the release of 0. 1, we intend to have implemented the following:

* HEFT
* PHEFT
* MOLS
* NSGAII\* 
* SPEAII\*

Workflow Representation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Workflows will be initialised based on either a NetworkX DiGraph in a users code, or read in from a .json file. 

Environment Representation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* The environment on which workflows are being scheduled will be initialised either through a user-implemented dictionary, or from a .json file.

Visualisation 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Able to plot different x/y pairings (throughput vs. time, compare two plots makespan etc.)

Documentation: 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Docstrings for each algorithm
* Introduction page with example model
* Class descriptions 
* Algorithm descriptions
